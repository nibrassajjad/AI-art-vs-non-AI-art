# AI-artbench folder
 This is the folder with the final algorithm for analysis.
 
 ./AI-artbench/model 1 32px/ai-artbench-ai-vs-human-art-detection.ipynb contains the code for the 32 x 32 input model.
 
 ./AI-artbench/model 2 128px/ai-artbench-ai-vs-human-art-detection-128px.ipynb contains the code for the 128 x 128 input model.

 For both models, the final saved model is best_model.h5 in their respective folders.

 # CIFAKE folder

 This folder is obsolete as this dataset was found to be not useful for the purpose of this research.

 # Classifier
 
The file here contains the code for testing the algorithm with user input images.
Modify the model location in the first code cell as per the location of best_model.h5 file.
